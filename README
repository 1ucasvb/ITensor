A C++ library for creating efficient and flexible physics simulations based 
on tensor product wavefunctions.

The foundation of the library is the Intelligent Tensor or ITensor. 
Contracting ITensors is no harder than multiplying scalars: matching indices 
automatically find each other and contract. This makes it easy to transcribe 
tensor network diagrams into correct, efficient code.
