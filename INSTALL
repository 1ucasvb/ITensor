Installation Instructions

### Building the Libraries

1. Download the boost library (http://www.boost.org). This is a free, high quality, open source C++ library used extensively by ITensor and
   potentially helpful for your own application development.

2. Edit the user configurable options. Start by making a copy of the sample options file: "cp options.mk.sample options.mk". Now edit the options.mk file in your favorite text editor. At a minimum, you must make sure that BOOST_DIR points to the location of your unpacked boost libraries folder (the default is a folder called 'boost' one directory above this file). Also, if you are using a system other than a recent Mac, edit the PLATFORM, BLAS_LAPACK_INCLUDEFLAGS and BLAS_LAPACK_LIBFLAGS to reflect the type and location of BLAS/LAPACK libraries.

3. Finally, at the toplevel directory of the library (same location as this file), type "make". If all goes well, the built library files should appear in the LIBDIR folder specified in options.mk.
